		<h2>More About Me</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>My Childhood</summary>
				<p>I was born in China and I was adopted as a baby. I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts near Cape Cod. I have lived in the same town my entire childhood but my family has moved 7 times in the same town. As a child I participated in a variety of sports and activities such as swimming, karate, softball, dance, soccer, basketball, and Girl Scouts. I was very creative and artsy so I loved to draw, paint, and make pottery as a kid.</p>
